# Victory Through Leadership
Final project for HTML5 and CSS3 Course

This is the code repository for the final project of an HTML5 and CSS3 course at Southwest Tech in Cedar City, UT based on the HTML5 and CSS3 Complete Second Edition by Sasha Vodnik.

The website is essentially a personal, passion project that will evolve over time as I undergo further courses. As it exists today (5/3/2018), it demonstrates basic knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 concepts. Style sheets are located in the "misc" directory, future images (such as logos and mobile icons) will go in the "images" directory, javascript scripts are in the "scripts" directory, and images of code being validated are located in the "Code Validation Images" directory (a general requirement of assignments at Southwest Tech). A template html file is also included in the "misc" directory in order to facilitate quicker page builds.

The idea of the website (beyond being a showcase for the author's web development skillset) is to synthesize the fields of online video gaming, group psychology, philosophy, ethics, and leadership. There are many online communities centered around video game mechanics and how to improve as an individual player, or perhaps even sites that talk about how the the mechanics of each player's role in a game can synergize together for greater effeciency, but there resources about how to manage the human element common to groups are few and far between. 

Effective online gaming groups are governed by the same principles of leadership and social dynamics that make any grouping effective, and by discussing these ideas within the context of gaming, I hope to encourage a more mature gamer base and perhaps even engender more respect for gaming as a hobby. Many of the principles of leadership I honed as a teenager running online gaming teams panned out to a practical, real-world skill set in my first management position at an employer and even as an enlisted member of the United States Marine Corps.

# KNOWN ISSUES 

Right now, the site is essentially a framework and proof of concept. As such, there are a few dead links. For example, the "Game Resources" page has links that don't actually point anywhere - the idea is that down the line, popular online games which focus on group play will have their own dedicated resource page where the user can explore community resources, with links to helpful subreddits, discord communities, youtube content creators, text and visual guides, and so on. While Final Fantasy XIV and Counter Strike: Global Offensive are listed and "linked," this is for demonstration purposes only (to get a sense for how the page would look). An embedded YouTube video is also included in the format to show how the stylesheet handles such an element.

The contact page contains similar dead links for Tweeting (as I don't have any social media set up for the site) and the Discord link (as there is no currently extant Discord server for this website). Likewise, the footer is "incomplete" insofar as it is missing relevant social media links I intend to include at a later point.

Lastly, microdata will be added at a later point as well, once the content is closer to being publishable and everything else (like social media accounts and links) are in place. Likewise, the hashtag feeds featured might not be the final ones featured (or may not even feature at all into the final design, being replaced with different sidebar content altogether).

Again, this is a WiP and, at this stage, a bit of a proof of concept to demonstrate the skeletal framework of the underlying HTML and CSS.
