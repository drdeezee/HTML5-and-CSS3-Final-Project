         HTML5 and CSS3 Final Project

         The intent of these pages is to be a framework to show off basic design elements. I am not a graphics design person so obviously my chosen color scheme is probably awful, likewise, I don't yet have any actual logos for the site, whether they be a main logo or android/itouch logos. Social media integration and microdata will be something to add as the site nears a "live-ready" status as well.

			   <section>
			      <h3>Introduction</h3>
			      <p>Many popular online games, whether competitive or cooperative, are designed around playing in groups. While many resources exist for players to look up specific information about a particular game - such as information about the weapon damage of various guns in an FPS, or the attacks and mechanics that bosses use in MMOs - finding information about successful group information can be a bit trickier.</p>
                  <p>Granted, there may be information regarding gameplay tactics revolving around groups. By this, I mean, a website might suggest you have certain players play in certain roles, go to certain points on a map (in an FPS) or handle certain mechanics (in an MMO). But I've found there's a distinct lack of information on the underlying "human" elements of group synergy - things like group psychology, what makes a good group leader, good communication practices, the ethics of a good group, and so on.</p>
                  <p>I'm someone who's been involved in leadership and interested in philosophy from a young age, and I'm also trained in psychology. Moreover, I've been playing video games practically since birth, and I've been rather seriously involved in various levels of group gaming since I was a teenager in 2004. I've found that successful leadership can not only impact a group's overall success, it can lead to individual breakthroughs, stronger relationships and more enjoyment overall.</p>

			      <h3>Scope</h3>
			      <p>What I envision for this site in the long term is the development of a community of like-minded gamers who would like to see mature groups and mature leaders spread throughout the medium. There's always been a bit of a stigma when it comes to people who game, and especially to people who game 'seriously,' that is to say, who attempt to do so at a high skill level (or apply the high-level meta of a game to their own gameplay). In the MMO community, for example, there's even a joke that participating in the end-game "raid" scene can be like a second job - good luck, however, putting down any raid accomplishments on your resume.</p>
                  <p>What if, however, we lived in a world where you actually <i>could</i> put your raid accomplishments (or competitive accomplishments in Counter Strike, or Overweatch) down on a resume? Volunteer work is appropriate for resumes, and the amount of work, maturity, dedication and passion that can go into building a successful gaming group can almost certainly translate into desirable traits from an employment perspective. I know I picked up on many leadership traits playing games in my teens before I was promoted to retail management at a very early age, and I took those skills with me into the Marine Corps where they were developed even further.</p>
                  <p>While I personally only have direct experience with a handful of games and genres, it is my hope to attract similar subject matter experts to share their insights into what makes successful groups here on the site as well. Some of the content on the site may be more or less grounded in video games or specific examples of video games, but from time to time there may also be more general articles discussing certain key concepts without being grounded in gaming.</p>

                  <h3>About the Author</h3>
                  <p>John Donner was very nearly born with an NES controller in his hand. His mother played NES classics like Super Mario Bros. 3 and Ninja Gaiden during her pregnancy, and his older brother often handed off the second player controller to an infant John whilst keeping the first player controller hidden.</p>
                  <p>John learned to read at an early age because his family got tired of reading the text from his games for him. In high school, he was introduced to PC gaming through LAN parties, and he started getting involved in running PC tournaments for his local LAN group, which eventually blossomed into running PC tournaments for early Penny Arcade EXPO events as an Enforcer.</p>
                  <p>John enlisted in the Marine Corps in 2007, and was honorably discharged due to a medical condition in 2011. He studied Pyschology aftewards, receiving a BA in the field with a minor in Sociology in 2016. He values freedom of thought; freedom of speech; thinking logically through beliefs and opinions; and has a healthy respect for intellectual debate. His most common online moniker is "Dr. Deezee" or "Deezee," which derived from a joke nickname he picked up playing middle school (American) football.</p>
