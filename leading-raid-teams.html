			      <h3>A Bit of Preamble</h3>
			      <p>I honestly don't know how the sub will react to this kind of a write-up, but writing tends to help me clarify my thinking and I believe there may be some value to discussing some of these topics more widely, so here goes.</p>
                  <p>After some lengthy conversations with an FC mate (who I used to raid with but no longer do because of swapping statics due to static management issues) regarding general malaise over statics, I was asked the pointed question - "John, why don't you just make your own static?"</p>
                  <p>I certainly had the opportunity to, before Savage released. I built a linkshell centered around Rav EX and Alex normal farms before Savage had dropped and populated it with about 80 people, many of whom were asking me about my own static situation (whether I was making one, part of one, wanted to be in theirs, or if they could be in mine). I had virtually no reputation on the server at large at/prior to this juncture, having only played about a month of ARR during 2.3 to get to level cap and quitting when my friends weren't playing nearly as much as me (returning two weeks before HW when it turned out one of those friends had kept playing, recruited many of his own IRL friends and had a small but friendly, active and helpful FC). I hadn't touched coil at all and the hardest content I'd cleared was Titan EX (with echo). So I had that same problem a lot of people trying to break into a static had - I wanted to tackle end game, but in order to tackle end game most people want you to have end game experience (and at this point people were asking about coil experience).</p>
                  <p>This still being the preamble, at this juncture it's relevant to give a little personal background. Generally, when it comes to multiplayer games, I gravitate towards trying to play at a high level, and 9 times out of 10 I end up "running the team." This isn't to toot my own horn, but it kind of ends up happening a lot. Beyond (let's face it) trivial video game leadership positions, I've also found myself in a lot of leadership positions in the rest of my life - elected as a class representative, running LAN party tournaments (including running the PC tournaments at PAX for its first couple of years before I enlisted), being promoted to management quickly at my first two real jobs, and of course the leadership training provided in the Marine Corps, to name a few things. I once wrote an essay on a largish blog (now defunct) titled "Leading with Reluctance: The Strategy of the Recluse." I'm perfectly happy following good leaders (and learning how to be a follower is a key step to becoming a leader) but I'm much less happy with ineffective leadership. And I certainly don't lust for the power of leadership so that I can personally profit; I just want to see solid leadership in place because when leadership is strong everyone benefits.</p>
                  <p>But back to more Eorzea specifics: Because of my current living situation, I have a lot more free time to dump into the game than other people do (medical retirement from the military) so I got to 60 quicker than a lot of people in the FC were able to. I spent 40+ hours wiping to Bis EX alone in random PF groups trying to get a clear before I finally cleared it in a party where 6 of the 8 people were in my FC. People in my FC had expressed interest in attempting to do Savage, and because they were some of the better people I'd played with I figured I'd just wait and see what developed with the FC static. Which finally brings us out of the preamble and into the first major point to discuss when it comes to raid team management:</p>
            </section>
			<section>
			   <h3>Lack of Leadership</h3>
			   <p>Authority for the "FC Static" was never very clearly delineated. Someone was put in charge but didn't necessarily take charge. If you're trying to get in on a raid tier while it's fresh (which, honestly, is the best time to get into it), you need to sort out your line up like a week in advance, if not more. Who are your two tanks, who are your two healers, and who are your four dps? We certainly had enough people in the FC actively playing at the time, with what seemed like enough job distribution, that it seemed possible we could have all 8 players be in our FC. As Savage drew nearer and nearer, however, it became more and more apparent that we might need a healer or two. This slot could've been filled from the linkshell I mentioned earlier; however the static decided to adopt a kind of "wait and see" approach.</p>
			   <p>Glossing over some other issues, we didn't even try Savage until the 3rd week of it being out, and at this point recruiting was much more difficult than before Savage dropped because anyone serious about raiding was already in a committed group. Moreover, because most of the core of the FC consisted of IRL friends, it was never clearly decided whether the static was going to be an actual static (in the sense that when we found people who performed well we offered them a slot) or a sort of revolving door situation where we subbed players week to week until people in the FC were ready to have their go at Savage. The "static" ended up being more of the latter, with only 5 people being regulars and the other 3 being different every single time we ran A1S. Because of this and also because I was looking to raid a bit more frequently (we only ran twice a week for an hour and a half at a time) I ended up amicably parting ways for a more active group, which involved changing my main job as well.</p>
			   <p>My current static has cleared A1S for ten weeks or so, and I think 8 weeks of A2S clears, but we have hit that A3S wall and are struggling. Without going into all of the specifics about my current static, I'll instead clump a lot of what's going on into a second large problem category:</p>
			</section>
            <section>
			   <h3>Social Dynamics</h3>
			   <p>I suppose social dynamics also played a part in the FC static situation, but anyway. Social skills very much play into any kind of leadership role, and it's no different in an MMO or a competitive gaming team. If you're afraid of confrontations or don't like talking to people, you probably shouldn't be in leadership. You also shouldn't be in leadership if you're just like to insult, belittle and cut people down. The "elitist" mentality in competitive video games is actually very counter productive to good leadership (and, you'll find, largely absent at the actual highest levels of play). What I mean by this is the sorts of people who are constantly complaining about how "bad" everyone is, how they don't want to play "with bads," and so on. Often times the top players of any given game are the ones disseminating the strategies for others to emulate and doing their part to raise everyone up; at some point people do these same things, get a sense of superiority, and lord their refracted glory over others. I don't follow the biggest names in FFXIV too closely but what I've seen from Elysium, for example, tends to indicate to me that they're the sort that's trying to share information and help people out. Another good example of this sort of top tier player in another capacity would be Day[9] when it comes to StarCraft.</p>
			   <p>Anyway, as a raid leader, the raid's overall performance kind of falls to you. If there are people who are holding progression back, it falls to you to identify who is holding whom back, why there's blockage in the first place, and how to correct that. In my experience, there seems to be a failure of leadership at any step in this process, if not multiple steps at the same time. Sometimes raid leaders can't even identify why the raid isn't progressing, other times they completely misattributed the reason for a lack of progression, other times they completely fail at redressing the shortcomings. There can be a billion reasons why these things happen but the most difficult ones to deal with are generally related to social dynamics and confrontation. It's not easy or fun to be the person who, after analyzing the data, realizes progression is being held up because one or two people are playing sub-optimally. It's not easy to confront the players who are sub-optimal and broach the subject in an non-insulting manner. It's especially not easy if you are "friends" with these people. And even if you can do all of these things, once you've done them, how long do you wait for signs of improvement to show up before you have to escalate the situation? Do you even bother?</p>
			   <p>If I haven't made it clear, what I'm getting at is there's much more to raid leadership than simply just being knowledgeable about the game, maximizing synergy with your raid comp, and being the loot master. And that's because all of the things I've just mentioned pertain much more exclusively to the "raid" part of the equation than they do the "leadership" part of the equation. So, having discussed problems for so long, let's start talking about effective strategies.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			   <h3>Dictation versus Inspiration</h3>
			   <p>I find a lot of people who adopt the snub-nosed Drill Instructor barking orders or some other similarly draconian figure as some kind of leader to hold up as an ideal. These types of dictatorial leaders tend to lead because they command fear but not necessarily respect; people do what they say because they're the ones in charge and if you don't do what they say there are consequences to suffer. (In terms of an FFXIV static, perhaps you don't want to piss off the raid leader because if you do you'll get booted from the static, and then what?) Generally speaking, a person motivated by fear of a leader will do the bare minimum to get by, whereas a person inspired by respect for their leader is much more likely to go above and beyond.</p>
			   <p>Here's an excerpt from that essay on leadership I mentioned in the preamble:</p>
			   <p class="quote">It is an irony of effective leadership that in order to lead you must not be thought of as striving to be a leader; by this I mean to say people cannot and should not view you as power hungry or out for personal gain. Humility is key in this regard, and I usually go one step further than downplaying my abilities. Rather than being merely humble, I exaggerate my weaknesses. For example, when I receive a compliment about my intelligence, I might deflect it by saying something like “I’m just a high school drop out who enlisted in the Marine Corps – what do I know?”</p>
			   <p>The essay closes with a simple encapsulation of my thoughts on these two different approaches. "Authority obligates; leadership inspires."</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			   <h3>Walking the Walk</h3>
			   <p>There's many cliched ways of putting it, but on the whole people don't like being subordinate to hypocrites. There are many different degrees of hypocrisy but it kind of comes down to that old rub about "you talk the talk, but can you walk the walk?" In the context of a raid team, I've heard of multiple statics where the lowest performing member will be the raid lead, and yet they can take on a hard line attitude telling other people to up their performances. Who knows - perhaps those other people DO need to step up their game, but it's going to be a difficult pill to swallow when the person telling them to step it up is performing worse than they are. This doesn't mean you always have to be the top dog in order to lead a raid team, but it does mean you might have to approach this situation differently. Instead of singling other people out, for example, you can include yourself. Even a simple, "we all need to improve - myself included!" is likely to get you a lot more traction than "hey DRG, you need to step up your DPS!"</p>
			   <p>I could go on about other general leadership things, but I don't feel like effectively running a raid team (or video game team) requires a super in depth discussion on all of the nuances of leadership. It's a lot easier to earn the respect of people in FFXIV than it is to earn the respect of another active duty Marine you don't already know, believe you me.</p>
			   <p>So I'll address one final point that bothers me when it comes to my experience with statics so far:</p>
			</section>
			<section>
			   <h3>Recruiting</h3>
			   <p>When an A3S progression static loses someone for whatever reason, the standard move seems to be to try to recruit someone with a similar amount of experience and gear level to fill the missing slot. This seems to make a high degree of intuitive sense, but is it really the best strategy?</p>
			   <p>Its effectiveness is going to depend quite heavily on the raiding population of your server, but I don't see it being an effective recruiting strategy in the middle of a raid tier for a few reasons. For one, players who have that kind of experience are probably already in a static or they unsubbed from the game because that's the thing to do now. If, on the off chance, there is that one person who matches the experience you want with the gear you want in the job you want and isn't in a static, you have to wonder - what happened with their old static? You could just luckily find a person who pugged their way to that gear level and experience, sure, but that again is going to depend quite heavily on which server you're on. (My server has very little pug activity for any floor of Savage, generally.)</p>
			   <p>A lot of groups can't seem to be bothered with trying out an unknown person, especially the further into progression they get. I'm running out of characters so to make a long story short, my current static took a big chance on me (I was very behind in eso and almost didn't have a Hive weapon, tanking with a job I didn't have any real experience with) and we all ended up getting farther than any of us had gotten before, eventually clearing a week or two later. (And when I first cleared I parsed quite low; now I'm consistently breaking the 75th percentile according to FFlogs.)</p>
			   <p>Now that we find ourselves in a situation where we need to replace a member due to work obligations, I am a bit dismayed that several people only want to try people who have an "A1S clear" as a bare minimum, but would prefer not to bother with anyone who has less than an A2S clear under their belt. I can understand the feeling of not wanting to go back to potentially having to "struggle" to clear earlier turns again, but waiting for the perfect player to plop into your lap could be a long wait for a train that ain't comin.</p>
			   <p>I would make the argument that attitude goes a lot farther than someone's ilvl or experience. When you get right down to it, 90% of being good at this game comes down to knowledge - knowledge of a fight, knowledge of stats, knowledge of your rotation, knowledge of synergies with other jobs, and so on. All of these things can easily be taught to and learned by someone with the right attitude. But someone with the wrong attitude can implode a static when push comes to shove or think they're beyond learning.</p>
			</section>

			   <h3>TL;DR</h3>
			   <p>Leading a raid is more than being a good raider, and the hardest bits are common to any leadership role - social dynamics, inspiring exceptional performance rather than demanding it, and good interpersonal skills.</p>
